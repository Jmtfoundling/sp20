# PH 142

This repo hosts the source files for PH142's Spring 2020 [website](https://ph142-ucb.github.io/sp20/).

This site is built from Kevin Lin's [Just the Class](https://github.com/kevinlin1/just-the-class).

### Editing the website

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ph142-ucb/sp20.git
```
2. Make edits on `master` (git add, commit, push)
3. Feel free to push straight to master. You should see changes reflected on the course website within 2-3 minutes.

See this [amazing video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azPPK5aOcV0&feature=youtu.be&t=460s) that [Suraj](https://github.com/surajrampure) made for Data100.

-- or just ping Nolan on Slack.


### Local development environment

Just the Class is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

1. Follow the GitHub documentation for [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
2. Start your local Jekyll server.
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
3. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
4. Reload your web browser after making a change to preview its effect.
